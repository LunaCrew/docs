# Tests

### Unitary tests

For unit testing we use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), a simple and objective JavaScript testing framework.

Jest can reliably run tests in parallel. It can also collect code coverage information from entire projects, including untested files.

### End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (E2E) testing we use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that runs in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and convenient.

The main functions of Cypress are to automate, accelerate and debug testing of modern web applications. Cypress also offers its own dashboard that shows exactly what is happening during test execution.
